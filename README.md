## Introduction
Disk scheduling is an essential function of operating systems, where I/O requests arriving for the disk are scheduled. This website helps in understanding and simulating different disk scheduling algorithms including FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, and C-LOOK.

## Features
- Informational content about each disk scheduling algorithm.
- Simulations of the following algorithms:
  - FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
  - SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
  - SCAN
  - C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)
  - LOOK
  - C-LOOK (Circular LOOK)
- Comparison of different algorithms.
- Responsive design with Bootstrap.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/manavukani/Disk-Scheduling-Algorithm-Simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd disk-scheduling-algorithms
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the website.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` to view the homepage.
2. Navigate through the menu to learn about different disk scheduling algorithms.
3. Use the "Simulate" links under each algorithm to see how they work.
4. Visit the "Comparison of Algorithms" page to compare different algorithms.
